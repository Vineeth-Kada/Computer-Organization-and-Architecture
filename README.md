## Cache Simulator

[Detailed problem statement](https://github.com/Vineeth-Kada/Computer-Organization-and-Architecture/blob/main/Cache%20Simulator/Problem%20Statement.pdf)
* Implemented a single level cache with random, [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)), and [pseudo LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Pseudo-LRU_(PLRU)) replacement policies.
* User can customize cache size, block size, and associativity.
* Given memory trace, finds counts on number of accesses, misses and evictions

## Pipelined Processor
[Detailed problem statement](https://github.com/Vineeth-Kada/Computer-Organization-and-Architecture/blob/main/Pipelined%20Processor/Problem%20Statement.pdf)
* 5 Stage Scalar Pipelined Processor, it can execute arithmetic, logic, data(load & store) and control instructions.
* Given instruction cache, data cache and register file contents, it executes the program and provides insights like total number of cycles, clock cycles per instruction, number of stalls, stalls due to RAW hazards and number of control stalls.
